## Weekly topic
### Why esr recommend newbie to study Golang instead of Rust?
- Go is more simpler than rust. It‚Äùs easier to read Go code.
- 

## Sporadic ideas
- Mastodon is designed well but less people use it than twitter.
- Raspberry Pi is funny, and it is wildly used in worldwide, not only because it is relatively cheap, but also it is very small(will be better if port can be more smaller, but cool down is still a problem), so it can be arranged at lots of places. So the portability is essential to the technology.
- The ability to concentrate is precious in this Internet era where you can get any information just by jabbing the keyboard.
